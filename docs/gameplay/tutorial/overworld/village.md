# Overworld: Village

## Introduction

Villages are often considered the simplest of overworld types and the most beginner friendly. They always have plenty of food, wood, and beds.

## Seed Type Distribution
| Elo     | Village |
| :--------: | :-----: |
| 0 ~ 599    | 55% |
| 600 ~ 1199 | 30% |
| 1200+      | 20% |

## Specifics

- Spawns within 7 chunks
  - Always generated at positive coordinates for X and Y
- Contains a guaranteed Blacksmith
  - Desert Villages may only have a toolsmith
- 3 lava pools are guaranteed near the Village OR the Blacksmith contains 8+ Obsidian for an enter with blacksmith lava
- Artificial lava pools look similar to vanilla and are the 3 guaranteed ones! There may be more vanilla lava pools but the artificial ones are guaranteed.
- Taiga villages always have 10+ Obsidian enters (lava pools do still exist)
- Golem only ever drops 4 Iron, never 3 or never 5.
- There will always be enough iron / diamonds for an iron / diamond pickaxe and an enter.
  - This can sometimes mean 8+ obsidian with only 4 iron / diamonds for a pickaxe and a flint and steel.

## Goals

While very easy initially, the village seed type is often regarded as the most complicated seed type (or the most non-linear) as you can practically do most of your tasks in any order, adding a lot of variability.

This being said, the usual progression of the village is:

- Looting the blacksmith
- Getting 1-2 beds
- Getting 5+ haybales
- Killing the golem if needed
- Finding flint and water
- Entering

The first three goals can be done in any order, so use the route that is the quickest and most linear.

# Strategies

Note: Taiga and Snowy Villages rarely appear and will not be covered in the strategies.

## All Village Strategies

- To kill the golem, simply stack up three blocks as he can't hit you and use your sword or axe.
  - You can place a crafting table at your feet to overlap crafting a boat, bread, and other items as your axe recharges its crit.
- If you get six iron, it is usually not worth it to woodlight with just an iron pickaxe and a bucket. Craft a shovel and shears instead.
  - If a ruined portal is close by, it is usually worth it to skip the golem due to a chance of flint, fire charges, and iron
- If you spawn next to a river, try to get flint by punching 3-4 pieces of gravel
  - You can overlap running to the lava pool and grinding gravel by running, placing gravel, and digging over and over.
