# Match-Making

## Explanation
When playing MCSR Ranked, you will be placed in a match against one other player of a similar skill level or Elo.

## Wait Times
In ranked mode you can expect to wait around 1 to 3 minutes to find a match. It is likely to take significantly longer if you have a particularly high or low Elo rating.

In casual mode, queue times are also significantly longer than in ranked mode unless you turn on the setting “Unlimited Casual Queue” detailed below.

## Matchmaking Settings
Matchmaking Settings can be found be going to Ranked > Settings > Matchmaking settings, when your instance is opened with Ranked installed.
- The first setting lets you cycle between three matchmaking options: accurate, balanced and fast. These options will change how fast it is to find a match by increasing the range of player Elo’s that you can matchmake against.
- The Unlimited Casual Queue setting allows you to matchmake against players of any Elo rating when playing casual mode. This significantly increases matchmaking times for this mode.
