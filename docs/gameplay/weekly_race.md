# Weekly Race Event

## Explanation
Ranked has a weekly race mode which can be found by selecting: Start A Match > Weekly Race. The seed and drop rates will be the same for all players and you can complete your run at anytime during the week. You can also repeat the run as many times as you like to complete it as fast as possible.

## Interface and Modes
A list of the top 50 runs can be found on the left side of the screen. You can watch a replay of these runs by selecting them and clicking the Watch Replay button.
