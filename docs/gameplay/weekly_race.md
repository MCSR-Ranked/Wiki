# Weekly Race Event

## Explanation
Ranked has a weekly race mode which can be found by selecting: Start A Match > Weekly Race. The seed and drop rates will be the same for all players and you can complete your run at anytime during the week. You can also repeat the run as many times as you like to complete it as fast as possible.

## Interface and Modes
A list of the top 50 runs can be found on the left side of the screen. You can watch a replay of these runs by selecting them and clicking the Watch Replay button.

There are three modes available:
-	Practice mode (Cheats are enabled)
-	Standard mode (Runs will count on the leaderboard)
-	Ghost mode (You will see an outline of the runner from the run that you selected, which allows you to pace yourself against another player. Runs still count on the leaderboard)
  
## Other Information
- A new race is created every Monday at 12am UTC.
- Ghost mode is activated by clicking on a run in the menu before pressing start to start your run.
- You can earn achievements and badges for placing highly in weekly races.
- There is a weekly race channel in our discord where strategy discussions often take place.
