# Achievements

Achievements can only be acquired in ranked matches. Most achievements can only be obtained once. The only exceptions to this are playoffs trophies, season placement badges, and weekly race achievements.

Achievements can be found on your ranked profile and up to 3 achievements of your choosing can be highlighted, with supporter tier 2 giving 4 highlighted achievements, and supporter tier 3 giving 5 highlighted achievements. More information about supporter tiers can be found on the [Ranked Store](https://mcsrranked.com/store).

Highlighted achievements will also be visible to your opponent when entering a match.
