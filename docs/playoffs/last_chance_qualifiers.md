# Last-Chance Qualifiers
The Playoffs Qualifier will be a one-day event. 
All players with **<u>20+ phase points</u>** from last season will be automatically invited. Learn more about the phase point system [here](./phase_point).

By the end of the event, we will determine 4 winners, who will earn a spot in the Season 6 Ranked Playoffs bracket. It is imperative that players only participate in the qualifier if they are certain they can make the dates for the next stage of the tournament. The 4 qualifiers will be seeded in the bracket based on phase point count as opposed to qualifier performance.

To reward players for their efforts throughout the season, we will be giving a small headstart to those with excess phase points. For every 5 phase points over the 20 point requirement, players will start with 1 point in the qualifier. So a player with 35 phase points would gain a 3 point advantage.

Players will have 15 minutes for each seed, or until up to 24 players have completed the seed, whichever comes first. Players who complete the seed will earn up to 20 points based on their placement. The point distribution will scale evenly depending on the number of possible completions for that round (max of 24).

At the end of some seeds, players will be eliminated based on the amount of points they have earned. Here is the elimination breakdown (Each elimination will happen AFTER the seed that it corresponds with)

- Seed 1 - No Eliminations
- Seed 2 - No Eliminations
- Seed 3 - <u>**All players with 0 points are eliminated**</u>
- Seed 4 - No Eliminations
- Seed 5 - <u>**Bottom 50% of remaining players are eliminated**</u>
- Seed 6 - No Eliminations
- Seed 7 - <u>**Only top 10 total points move on**</u>
- Seed 8 - <u>**Top 8 total points move on**</u>
- Seed 9 - <u>**Top 6 total points move on**</u>
- Seed 10 - <u>**Top 4 total points win!**</u>

In the event of a point tie that disrupts an elimination (ex. 10th and 11th are tied after seed 7), all involved players will move on to the next round, but the next elimination will remain unchanged. In the rare case there is a tie for last after seed 10, a sudden death seed will be played.
