# Main Bracket
The Main bracket, also known as the Playoffs bracket, will be a four-day event. 
At the end of the season, the 12 players with the most **___phase points___** will be automatically invited, seeded 1-12 respectively. Four additional players, seeded 13-16, are chosen through [last chance qualifiers](./last_chance_qualifiers). Learn more about the phase point system [here](./phase_point).

While the Main bracket has experienced some experiments in seasons 5 and 6, the Main bracket remains a traditional, single elimination 16-player bracket.The top 8 seeds in the bracket will pick their round 1 opponents from the players seeded 9-16, and the rest of the bracket will continue like normal with no more opponent picks.
