# Installation with Prism Launcher / MultiMC

## Launcher setup
If you're new to speedrunning, we recommend following [osh's guide](https://youtu.be/OEpZlv6cQsI) for setting everything up.

## Add Instance
We recommend using the official modpack, which includes other allowed QoL and performance mods. Download it from [here](./download#modpack).

Then, open your launcher, and either drag the `.mrpack` file into the launcher, or go to `Add Instance` -> `Import (from zip)`, and select it here. Finally, launch your new instance.

## (Advanced) Update Java
It's generally recommended to use `Java 17-22` for speedrunning for better performance and compatibility with some practice mods.
