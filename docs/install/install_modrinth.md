# Installation with Modrinth App

## Add Instance
We recommend using the official modpack, which includes other allowed QoL and performance mods. Download it from [here](./download#modpack).

Then, open Modrinth App, and go to `Create New Instance`, select `From File`, and choose the `.mrpack` file. Finally, launch your new instance.

## (Advanced) Update Java
It's generally recommended to use `Java 17+` for speedrunning for better performance and compatibility with some practice mods.
