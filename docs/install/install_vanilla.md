## Install Fabric Loader
Get the installer here: <https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/>. Open the installer, select `1.16.1` as the Minecraft version and the latest Fabric version, and finish the installation.
::: warning
You do **NOT** need Fabric API, it is banned and none of the allowed mods use it!

## Download the mods
Download the MCSR Ranked mod from [the Modrinth page](http://modrinth.com/mod/mcsr-ranked) into `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods`.

Additionally, it is recommended to get other allowed mods from https://mods.tildejustin.dev/.

## Launch the Profile
When you open your Minecraft launcher it will now show Fabric as an option. With that your mods will work.
