# Installation with Official Minecraft Launcher (Vanilla Launcher)

::: warning
⚠️ Not recommended — setup is more complicated.
<br>
We would recommend to use [Prism Launcher](./install_prism) instead.

::: info
This document will not explain the process of installing and logging into your Microsoft Account.

## Install Fabric Loader
Get the installer here: <https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/>. Open the installer, select `1.16.1` as the Minecraft version and the latest Fabric version, and finish the installation.
::: warning
You do **NOT** need Fabric API, it is banned and none of the allowed mods use it!
:::

## Download the mods
Download the MCSR Ranked mod from [the Modrinth page](http://modrinth.com/mod/mcsr-ranked)
Additionally, it is recommended to get other allowed mods from https://mods.tildejustin.dev/.

Under Launcher > Installations 
![Installation folder](https://img001.prntscr.com/file/img001/pwuJSPm5TlC7a842veB_pA.png) Create a new folder named "mcsr ranked" in this directory, and create a folder named "mods" inside that, 
then you can place the mods inside the newly created mods folder and edit the file directory for that modded instance.

## Launch the Profile
When you open your Minecraft launcher it will now show Fabric as an option. With that your mods will work.

## (Advanced) Update Java
It's generally recommended to use `Java 17+` for speedrunning for better performance and compatibility with some practice mods.
