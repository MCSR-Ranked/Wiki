# Contribution Guidelines

This page tells you everything you need to know to write a solid wiki page.

## Format and Layout

Pages should be broken up into sections defined with hashtags (`## Format and Layout`). Long paragraphs should be avoided. A template to guide new pages can be found at [Page Template](./page_template).

## Simple Prose

Keep the language of the wiki natural and easy to understand. Avoid long sentences, "filler" words and slang / idioms which don't translate well.

Sometimes words don't do a concept justice. Supporting images go a long way - these should be PNGs and kept inside the relevant `img` folder. Always add alt text.

## A Single Source of Truth

Duplicate information will make this wiki difficult to maintain when that information needs updating. Reference the page where reasonable, like this: `[Page Template](./page_template)`. Whenever moving or renaming a page, ensure any references to the page are updated.
