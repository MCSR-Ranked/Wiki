All seeds will feature a short break in between them (~3 minutes). Seeds 3, 5, and 7 are the large-scale elimination seeds, and thus will feature a longer break to confirm standings and update the Qualifiers private room whitelist (~7 minutes). The referee for the private room will start each seed at a designated time sent in Discord. The private room will not wait to start for any player - if the player is AFK when the room starts, then the player will assume all timeloss until they return from being AFK. <ul><li>The sole exception to this rule is a technological issue affecting the player’s ability to participate in the private room (e.g. internet issues).

If a player makes it to the final four and qualifies, they will be contacted shortly to schedule their upcoming Bracket matches.</li><li><u>Players seeded 1 through 8 in the bracket must be available at the end of the Qualifiers stream</u>. These players will be able to pick their preferred bracket opponent from the remaining eight qualified players. These picks will go in seed order (seed 1 will pick first from the eight players, then seed 2 will pick from the remaining seven players, etc.). These picks will be broadcasted live on the Qualifiers stream.</li></ol><h2 id="bracket-rules" tabindex="-1"><a href="./bracket">Bracket</a> Rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#bracket-rules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Bracket](./bracket) Rules&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>Each Bracket match will operate on a <strong>no-break</strong> schedule. After each seed, there will be a couple minutes of split analysis and seed selection analysis before the next seed will commence. Additionally, certain seeds will be followed by an analysis segment, usually lasting 3-5 minutes. These downtime periods are more than enough time for any short interruptions a player may have during their bracket match. Thus, no breaks will be permitted during a Bracket match. Each seed will start soon after the previous seed is completed, and the Playoffs referee will provide updates on each seed’s precise start time. Players may also pull up the main stream in between seeds to help keep themselves on schedule. <ul><li>The sole exception to this rule is a technological issue affecting the player’s ability to participate in the private room (e.g. internet issues).
